### 3b. Civic Technology Working Group (aka Communication Infrastructure)

- *propose renaming Communication Infrastructure Working Group*

- **Comm Das Gupta** presented slides to Austin CityUp group

  - Telecom Providers Grande & Time Warner are advertising that they are providing gigabit service.

  - **Comm Das Gupta** is setting up meeting with Mayor's office (Sly) to brainstorm activating a plan to make Austin a "real" gigabit City.

- **Comm Vaughn** update on Google Fiber Community Connections

  - met with Google Fiber (Parisa, Matt from SMB team)
  - Is Google Fiber providing any additional support to non profits beyond initial wiring?
    - three tiers of community connections (Arts, Social Health, Public)
    - two fiscal years ago, Council set aside funds for switches and routers for future deployment at all City sites.
    - question remains about what support is needed for non-profits
      - help center articles
      - formulating a plan
  - **Comm Das Gupta** still no progress on connections for D10.
    - wiring up with latest technology is important, hardware is quickly outdated, planning for frequent updates.

### 3c. Community Engagement Working Group

- **Comm Yeatts** announces that neighbor planning group is now offering classes on how to get information out of the City website.
  - scheduled a class for his own neighborhood, Nov 17th (?)
  - Neighborhood groups are interested in topics like: 
    - Planning Commission agenda items
    - neighborhood contact teams
    - GIS information
  - **Comm Das Gupta** city websites have too much information, recommends to increase white space.
    - are there ways to give feedback to the City?
      - ex: simplify content
      - unify content between departments
      - **Comm Yeatts** each department has control over their own section of the website thus hard to maintain standards
    - **Comm Williams** suggests collecting formal suggestions from community members as a baseline to pass on to departments
    - **Comm Williams** potential action item for Open Gov Working Group, this is a user test group. Guided sessions with specific outcome of gathering usability feedback.
      - **Comm Das Gupta** recognizes this is a key part of Open Government ideals
      - **Comm Clarke** other cities  have Community User Testing (CUT) Groups via community civic tech orgs (Miami, Chicago), this make be a good recommendation for our Commission to provide Council
