### 1. Hack the Traffic

  - ATD & UT Center for Transportation Research organized and executed the logistics for this event. In alignment with Open Data Day, ATD released a host of bluetooth sensor traffic data. They also encouraged participants to create low cost sensors. I want to highlight this quote with one of the organizers that I 100% agree with: 
    - “It’s about building a relationship between the public and government in a new way, a technological way,” Clary said. “Smart cities aren’t just about buying technology. To me being a smart city means making the most of the resources that we have.”

### 2. ICE Raids, Mass Deportation, and Data Collection
  - I shared Commissioner Newell's and my concerns about the agenda of the Trump administration to deport non-criminals and the role of local government data collection in this effort. I know this is a controversial topic, but I'm looking for other commissioners that are interested in exploring a set of recommendations we could prepare for our Council that would seek to protect citizens from data collection related to religion and immigration status that might make them undue target of this regime.
